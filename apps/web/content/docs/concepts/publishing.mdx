When submitting your app to the App Store or Google Play, you'll need to disclose how Phase Analytics collects and uses data. This guide helps you accurately complete the required privacy forms.

<Callout type="info">
Phase is privacy-first and collects no personally identifiable information (PII) by default. All data collection is anonymous unless you explicitly identify users.
</Callout>

## iOS (Apple App Store)

When submitting your app to the App Store, you'll need to complete Apple's App Privacy questionnaire.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Data Collection">
**Does your app collect data?**
Select **Yes** - Phase collects anonymous analytics data.

**Do you or your third-party partners collect data from this app?**

<Callout type="warn">
If you call `Phase.identify()` with personally identifiable information (email, name, user ID), you must select "Yes" for linking data to user identity and disclose which data types you're collecting.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tracking">
**Do you or your third-party partners use data from this app for tracking purposes?**
Select **No** - Phase does not track users across apps and websites owned by other companies for targeted advertising or ad measurement purposes.

</Accordions>

## Android (Google Play Store)

When submitting your app to Google Play, you'll need to complete the Data Safety form.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="User Control">

## Best Practices

- **Review before each release** - Privacy requirements may change with app store policy updates
- **Match your implementation** - Only disclose data types you actually collect through Phase
- **Document custom properties** - If you track custom user properties with PII, update your privacy policy
- **Test before submission** - Review your app's data collection behavior in production builds
- **Keep privacy policy updated** - Ensure your app's privacy policy accurately reflects Phase usage
